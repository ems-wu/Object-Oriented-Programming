FINAL HANDIN

Overview: My project contains these 4 classes that I created and they interact in the following ways:
  - App instantiates PaneOrganizer, my top level object. 
  - PaneOrganizer, my top level class and is responsible for some of the graphic elements,
  but mostly delegates user input and animation to Cartoon and Ironman classes. This is where I instantiate my
  cartoon class. I also instantiate my root Pane and provide a public getRoot() method to return the Pane. 
  - Cartoon class is where I set my timeline and create my label update. I instantiate my Ironman class here. 
  Cartoon is the top level object for my shapes and event handlers. 
  - Ironman is where I create my composite shape (the ironman head).

  
  In regards to my containment diagram, my App is the top box and contains PaneOrganizer and Scene. PaneOrganizer 
  contains Label and Button. Button is associated with ClickHandler. Scene is associated with Borderpane, which is 
  contained inside PaneOrganizer. All my shapes(Rectangle, Polygon, etc) inherit from the class Shape, which inherits 
  from Node. 
 
Design Choices:
  -I decided to create a floating Ironman head because Ironman is my favorite character
  from the Marvel Universe and really represents me in a lot of ways, from his inability to
  communicate like a normal human being, to his unconventional work habits. 
  -The design label changes from "Iron Go!" to "Where did he go!" after the head passes the 
  800 mark on the y coordinate plane.
