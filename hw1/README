Summary of the collaboration policy and rationale:
Answer: The belief is that the most effective way of learning computer science
is through working by yourself. There are tons of well-informed and helpful TAs
to guide us along, and pair-programming is allowed for labs. Cheating--copying
from online and other students, will result in various consequences. Discussing
course material is absolutely allowed, and it is okay to work together to work
on design problems and complete the mini assignment. However, you must work
alone for projects.
