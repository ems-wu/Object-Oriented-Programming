LiteBrite README

FINAL HANDIN

Overview: There are four classes total: App, ColorPalette, LiteBox, and
LiteBrite. I created the LiteBrite class myself. The LiteBrite class contains
the LiteBox and ColorPalette classes.

Answers and Design:
1. LiteBox is associated with ColorPalette. ColorPalette is passed into
LiteBox as a parameter, so LiteBox knows of ColorPalette.

2. One getter method I used was getcolor(), which I used in ColorPalette to
get the color so that the corresponding lite peg would be able to set the color.
The getColor method, located in the ColorPalette class, would get it's
current Color. By calling the accesor method, LiteBox can get the current color.

One setter method I used in my program was also in ColorPalette. I set the
color so that the initialized color variable could be set to whatever new color
that I, the user, clicked on.
