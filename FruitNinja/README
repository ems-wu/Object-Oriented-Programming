FINAL HANDIN

Overview: My project contains 10 classes. These interact in the following ways:
  - App instantializes FruitNinja, my top level object.
  - FruitNinja is my top level class and is a subclass of CS15Game
  Here, I start my game, create an instance of blade, and create my
  switch statement. My switch state allows me to "launch" a random object of
  type choppable in the air. I also override method onBladeContact to get
  a score for my game.
  - FruitNinjaFrame is a class already created for me and I just called
  addGame() onto it and passed in fruitninja to make the frame appear.
  - Fruit is a subclass of CS15Fruit and a superclass of the individual fruits.
  It inherits from CS15Fruit and is an example of polymorphism as it
  has access to all of CS15Fruit's methods
  - Bomb is a subclass of CS15Bomb and inherits all the capabilities from
  the parent class, showing an example of polymorphism
  - Lemon is a subclass of Fruit and inherits all methods from Fruit
  - Apple is a subclass of Fruit and inherits all methods from Fruit
  - Peach is a subclass of Fruit and inherits all methods from Fruit
  - Pear is a subclass of Fruit and inherits all methods from Fruit
  - Bomb is a subclass of Bomb and inherits all methods from CS15 Bomb

Design Choices:
  -I decided to set my switch statement random int range up to 5
  and made apples my default.
  -My fruits each return a different score, with my Apple returning 1,
  Lemon returning 2, Peach returning 3, and Pear returning 4.
